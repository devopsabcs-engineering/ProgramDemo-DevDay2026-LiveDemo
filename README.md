ms.date: 2026-02-16
---

## Overview

This repository contains the Developer Day 2026 demo for the Ontario Public Sector (OPS). The goal is to demonstrate how AI, specifically GitHub Copilot, accelerates building a production-ready web application from scratch.

OPS is launching a system that allows citizens of Ontario to submit program requests to the Government of Ontario. Ministry employees review submissions through an internal portal and notify citizens once a decision is made.

## Business Problem

1. Citizens submit a program request through a public-facing portal.
2. A Ministry employee reviews the submission within an internal portal.
3. Once approved or declined, a notification is sent to the citizen.

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Front End | React |
| Back End | Java API layer |
| Database | Azure SQL |
| Cloud Services | Azure Durable Functions, App Services, Logic Apps, AI Foundry (mini model), RBAC authentication |
| UI Design | Figma |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Security | GitHub Advanced Security (Dependabot, Secret Scanning) |
| Project Management | Azure DevOps (User Stories, Test Plans) |

## Demo Flow

The demo walks through the full development lifecycle, with each role using GitHub Copilot to accelerate their work.

### Planning

- Use M365 Chat to generate high-level user stories (Infrastructure, Backend, Front End, QA).
- Use GitHub Copilot to populate instruction files describing what we are building.
- Use GitHub Copilot to create an architecture diagram for the solution.

### Build

- **Infrastructure:** Pre-deployed Azure resources ready for integration.
- **DBA:** Connect to Azure SQL and load the database schema.
- **Backend Developer:** Pull a user story from Azure DevOps and use Copilot to build a backend solution with at least two APIs.
- **Front-End Developer:** Start from a Figma prototype, apply WCAG and Ontario.ca design assets, and use Copilot to build a local UI MVP.
- **QA:** Improve code coverage, build test plans, and push them to Azure DevOps.
- **DevOps:** Build CI pipelines with GitHub Actions to validate changes.
- **Power Platform:** Integrate workflows and automation (time permitting).

### Showcase

- Deploy the application to a public URL and demonstrate it fully working.
- If time allows, make a live change to show how Copilot handles iterative development.

## Key Features

- All screens are bilingual (English and French).
- Screens follow the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/).
- All screens meet [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) accessibility standards.
- Layout follows the [Government of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/) template where possible.

### Citizen Workflow

1. Register or sign in with a MyOntario account (stretch goal).
2. Submit a new program form containing:
   - Program Name
   - Program Description
   - Program Type (dropdown)
3. Optionally upload a supporting document.
4. Review the submission, accept the disclaimer, and submit.

### Ministry Workflow

1. Receive a notification when a new submission arrives.
2. Open the internal portal to review the program and supporting documents.
3. Add comments and approve or reject the submission.
4. The citizen receives a notification with the decision.
5. Optionally generate a confirmation letter for approved programs.

### Search

- Search by program name, with GitHub Copilot building the initial query.
- Add filters such as approval date range, with Copilot updating the query and screen.

## Live Change Demo

To demonstrate how Copilot handles iterative changes, add a new field to the program approval form and ask Copilot to:

1. Redesign the data model.
2. Update the program form UI.
3. Regenerate queries (insert, update, read).
4. Update unit tests.
5. Run accessibility tests.
6. Identify missing French translations.
7. Suggest handling of default values for existing records.
8. Regenerate architecture documents (Data Dictionary, Design Document).

## Lessons Learned from Dry Runs

Each rehearsal surfaces opportunities to streamline the live demo. The items below capture recurring themes so future iterations start from a stronger baseline.

### Use a Dev Container for Consistent Environments

Define a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` that includes Java 21, Node 20, Maven, and all required VS Code extensions. This enables one-click setup in GitHub Codespaces and works locally through the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container** feature in VS Code (requires Docker Desktop). A reproducible environment eliminates "works on my machine" issues and reduces setup time during the demo.

### Set Up .gitignore Early

Initialize `.gitignore` with combined rules for Java (`target/`, `*.class`), Node/npm (`node_modules/`, `dist/`), and IDE files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/settings.json`) before the first commit. Retroactively cleaning tracked build artifacts wastes demo time and creates noisy diffs.

### Introduce Testing Alongside Features

Avoid deferring all testing to a late QA phase. Add unit tests alongside each feature phase (backend tests with the API, frontend tests with the portal). This keeps coverage incremental, catches issues sooner, and demonstrates a shift-left testing culture during the demo.

### Generate a Research Plan and Talk Track Up Front

Before building, use Copilot to generate a structured research plan that maps each demo phase to time estimates, deliverables, and talking points. A pre-built talk track keeps the live session on pace and ensures no phase is skipped or rushed. Plan for an appropriate cliffhanger at the 70-minute mark (just before the lunch break) — leave the audience with a compelling "what's next" moment, such as a partially deployed application or a live change about to land, so they return eager to see the conclusion. Store the plan in `.copilot-tracking/research/` for easy reference.

### Use H2 for Local Development and Testing

Configure a Spring Boot `local` profile with an H2 in-memory database so developers can run and test the backend without an Azure SQL connection. This speeds up the inner development loop and removes cloud dependency during the demo. Reserve Azure SQL integration for the deployed environment.

### Auto-Version with Phase-Aware CI

The CI pipeline should auto-increment the patch version on every merge to `main` and increment the minor version at each phase boundary. Automated versioning produces clear release milestones and eliminates manual tagging errors.

### Surface Key Information in GitHub Workflow Summaries

Every GitHub Actions workflow should write relevant output to the **Job Summary** (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`). Examples include deployed URLs after a CD run, test pass/fail counts and coverage percentages after CI, and infrastructure resource names after a Bicep deployment. Surfacing this information directly in the GitHub UI reduces context-switching and makes the demo more visible to observers.

### Add GitHub Copilot Instructions Early

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files before writing any code. At minimum include:

- **ADO workflow instructions** — branching conventions (`feature/{id}-description`), commit message format (`AB#{id}`), PR linking (`Fixes AB#{id}`), and post-merge cleanup steps. This ensures every Copilot-generated commit and branch follows the project's Azure DevOps integration rules automatically.
- **Tech stack instructions** — coding standards for each layer (React/TypeScript, Java/Spring Boot, SQL, CI/CD). These guide Copilot to produce code that matches the project's conventions (e.g., Ontario Design System classes, bilingual i18next keys, Spring Data JPA patterns) without repeated prompting.

Without these files, Copilot lacks project context and produces generic code that requires manual correction.

### Configure MCP for Azure DevOps Integration

Set up `.vscode/mcp.json` at the start of the project so VS Code and Copilot can communicate with Azure DevOps directly. This enables work item discovery and test plan management without leaving the editor. A typical configuration points to the ADO organization and project:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["--organization", "MngEnvMCAP675646", "--project", "ProgramDemo-DevDay2026-LiveDemo"]
    }
  }
}
```

Without MCP configured early, developers lose the ability to pull user stories and manage test plans through Copilot — forcing manual context-switching to the Azure DevOps web portal.

### Containerize the Backend API for Deployment

Deploy the Java API as a Docker container rather than relying on the platform's built-in runtime. During dry runs, deploying the Spring Boot JAR directly to Azure App Service exposed TLS/SSL handshake failures between the App Service Java 21 stack and Azure SQL. Packaging the API in a container (using `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy`) with a known JRE and trusted certificate store eliminated these errors entirely. Containers also provide a consistent runtime across local development, CI, and production, removing an entire class of "works locally but fails in Azure" surprises. Build images with Azure Container Registry Tasks (`az acr build`) so no local Docker daemon is required during CI/CD.

### Embrace Azure DevOps and GitHub Better Together

This project follows a **better together** model where Azure DevOps and GitHub each handle what they do best:

- **Azure DevOps** — work item tracking (Epics, Features, User Stories, Bugs) and Test Plans. ADO provides structured boards, backlog management, and traceability.
- **GitHub** — source code repository, pull requests, CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions), and security (GitHub Advanced Security). GHAS provides Dependabot for dependency updates, secret scanning, and code scanning — capabilities that are native to the GitHub platform.

Commits link back to ADO work items via `AB#{id}` syntax, and PRs auto-close work items with `Fixes AB#{id}`. This gives full traceability from ADO boards to GitHub commits while keeping code, reviews, pipelines, and security scanning in GitHub where they integrate seamlessly.
